# Reflection:
The game Unpacking serves as a fascinating example of Kendall Walton’s theory of make-believe, where objects are more than just functional elements, but they are props that construct a fictional world and evoke meaning. In Unpacking, players interact with a series of pixelated objects stored inside cardboard boxes, arranging them within various living spaces over time. Though these crates are nothing more than digital assets, they become fictionally real within the game’s framework, much like how a child sees a stick as a horse in a game of make-believe. Walton argues that props generate fictional truths, and here, the act of removing an item from a box and placing it in a room tells a personal story. The crates themselves serve as narrative devices, marking transitions in the protagonist’s life, moving from childhood to adulthood, from dorm rooms to apartments and finally to a house, from relationships to solitude and eventually to family. Each object’s persistence, absence, or repositioning carries meaning, allowing players to unpack not just possessions but memories.

Unpacking is a prime example of prop-oriented make-believe, where the objects themselves help players understand and interpret a story world, and at the same time, it also engages deeply with content-oriented make-believe, where the fiction world itself is the focus. The game immerses players in the character’s world by simulating 3D spatial awareness within a 2D medium. Despite the game’s pixel-art style, it conveys depth and volume through careful layering, as objects can be placed behind or in front of others, interacting with the space in a way that mimics real-world constraints. When placing a book on a shelf, players instinctively rotate it to fit among other books, just as they would in real life. The toothbrush and toothpaste can be put in a cup, not scattered on the counter. This consideration of object orientation, volume, and spatial relationships matches with Walton’s argument that props in games of make-believe do not have to be physically real to generate fictional truths. A collection of pixels arranged in a particular way is fictionally a stack of plates, a folded towel, or a ceramic mug. This reflects Walton’s broader idea that our understanding of objects is shaped not just by their literal form but by how they function within a structured make-believe world. Beyond physical space that encourages the player to engage in imaginative participation on the fictional world in the game, Unpacking also uses object continuity and absence to describe a story. One of the most interesting examples is when the protagonist moves in with her boyfriend. As players attempt to place her belongings in his space, they quickly realize how limited room there is for her things, which is a metaphor for the imbalance in their relationship. The protagonist has to squeeze her items into the few available spots, even placing some of them in awkward locations because the space wasn’t designed with her in mind. Later in the game, when unpacking in a new apartment, players can notice that the boyfriend’s belongings are missing and the protagonist is back in her childhood home. Without any explicit dialogue, the game fictionally implies that the relationship has ended, using the props and the symbolic power of objects to tell a story of heartbreak and change. Walton’s idea of make-believe shaping perception is evident here, since players recognize the fictional truth of a breakup not because the game says it outright, but because the props within the world no longer align with previous fictional expectations. Just as Walton's example of "wistful melody" which not only helps describe a feature of music (prop-oriented) but also engages the listener in an imaginative experience (content-oriented), Unpacking uses both prop- and content-oriented make-believe to create an interactive resonant story. How many crates does it take to build a story world? The reading would argue that it’s not the number of crates that matters, but their function as anchors of fiction, each containing elements that define the character’s evolving experiences. Every box opened is an invitation to participate in the make-believe of memory and meaning, proving that even a collection of pixels can hold the weight of an entire life’s story.

Designing my Godot game connects directly to Walton’s idea that objects in a fictional world aren’t just functional but serve as triggers for imaginative engagement. In my game, chests and the key fragments in the chests aren’t just assets, but they act as props that shape the player’s experience and drive the story forward. The player isn’t simply collecting key fragments, but they’re engaging in a structured fiction where these objects take on meaning beyond their digital form. Also, a locked door in my game isn’t just an obstacle, but it represents a mystery, a challenge, or a moment of progression before earning the recognition of the sacred statue. Walton’s argument that props generate fictional truths is at play here, as the door isn’t “really” locked, but within the framework of the game, it is, and the player accepts that reality. By designing these interactions, I see how even the simplest objects can hold narrative weight, proving that make-believe isn’t just about grand stories, but about how we interact with the world, regardless real or fictional, through the things within it.
